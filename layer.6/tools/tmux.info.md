## Overview of tmux
tmux is not a standalone terminal application; it is a terminal multiplexer. This means it runs within a terminal and allows users to manage multiple terminal sessions from a single window.

## Key Features

### Multiplexing
Multiple Sessions: tmux enables the creation of several terminal sessions within one terminal window.
Detaching and Reattaching: Users can detach sessions, allowing processes to continue running in the background, and later reattach to them.

### Window Management
Panes: tmux allows splitting the terminal into multiple panes, each running its own shell or program.
Session Management: Users can manage multiple sessions, windows, and panes easily.
