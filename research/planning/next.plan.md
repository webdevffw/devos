## Suggestions for further research & planning

A natural next phase would be:

1. Choose **one orchestration backbone** (chezmoi vs Nix vs pure git)
2. Define the **single entry-point script**
3. Decide which layers are:

   * Declarative only
   * Declarative + generated
   * Intentionally manual

When you’re ready, we can:

* Design the repo structure
* Write the bootstrap script
* Or deep-dive one layer at a time (terminal → shell → prompt, etc.)

This is a really solid foundation—you’re thinking about this exactly the right way.
