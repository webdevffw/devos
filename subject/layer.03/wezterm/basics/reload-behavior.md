## 2️⃣ Reload behavior

### ✅ Hot reload supported

WezTerm supports:

```bash
CTRL+SHIFT+R
```

or command palette → Reload Configuration.

* Reloads most settings live.
* Fonts, colors, keybindings reload fine.
* Some system-level things may require restart (rare).

### ⚠️ Restart required (edge cases)

* Window decoration changes
* Some OS-level integrations

But 95% of changes are hot-reloaded.

So iteration is fast.
